Hey there! This is my portfolio project where I learned the basics of web development. It's split into two distinct parts: Lab 1 (Pure HTML) is just the skeletonâ€”the plain, unstyled structure of the site. Then we get to Lab 2 (HTML + CSS), where I brought in CSS to actually make it look good, handle the layout, and make it responsive.
